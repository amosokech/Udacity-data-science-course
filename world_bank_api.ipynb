    "# Using APIs with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This Ipython notebook shows you how to use the World Bank API with the Python requests library. At the end there is a short exercise for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access APIs in Python, you can use the [requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/user/install/). \n",
    "\n",
    "To install, you can go in a terminal and type:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install pipenv\n",
    "pipenv install requests\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the requests library, it's like putting an API url in a browser except now Python does this behind the scenes programatically and then stores the results in a variable. The classroom workspaces already have the requests library installed. Here is a demonstration of how the request library works."

A \"get\" request is generally reserved for obtaining data from a server. For the World Bank API, you'll only need to make \"get\" requests. An API's documentation will generally tell you what type of requests to make.\n",

You specify the country name with the [2-character ISO code](http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/country_code_list.htm) and then specify the economic indicator that you want, which in this case is `NY.GDP.MKTP.CD`. \n",
